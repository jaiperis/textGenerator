# textGenerator
I used machine learning to generate novel sentence from a set of text data (corpus). Programmed using Python 3.
I tested the program with Frankenstein and the Game of Thrones script. You can plug in any .txt scripts if you try it. 
This project was based around natural language processing theory. I used the nltk library to do the processing. 
I used trigrams to create grammitically-decent sentences. The sentences are made using weighted randomization.
